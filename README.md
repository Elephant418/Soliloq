Soliloque
==========

*Soliloque* is a PHP project to produce printable document in HTML/CSS.


How do I print my document?
----------
I advise you to [WeasyPrint](http://weasyprint.org/), the best tool I know to convert HTML/CSS documents to PDF.


What does Soliloque mean?
----------
*Soliloque* is an old French word that means somebody who speaks to himself.
I think it is appropriate because this project generate a web page to be printed.
You certainly will be the only one to see your web page.
