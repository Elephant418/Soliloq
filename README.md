Soliloq
==========

Soliloq is a PHP project to produce printable document in HTML/CSS.


How do I print my document?
----------
I advise you to use [WeasyPrint](http://weasyprint.org/), the best tool I know to convert HTML/CSS documents to PDF.


What does Soliloq mean?
----------
*Soliloque* is an old French word that means somebody who speaks to himself.

I think it is appropriate because this project generate a web page to be printed.
You certainly will be the only one to see your web page.
